This program simulate Bulls and Cows game.

1]  First of all, the computer will generate a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different.
2]  Then, in turn, the user tries to guess their computer's number. The computer prompts the user for a number and after the input has been received, the computer responds with the number of matching digits.
3]  If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows".

For example, let's say the number is 2017. A sample interaction might look like this:

Hi there!
I've generated a random 4 digit number for you.

0 bulls, 2 cows
>>> 6147
